## Information

The database structure is attached: 127_0_0_1.sql. It needs to be imported manually to a MySQL server (no functionality within the app to load it). Tables are empty but will get populated by the app.
    
Change database settings (if needed) in app/config/database.php.
   
Run 'composer update' and 'npm install'.
